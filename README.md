# Table of Contents (Optional)

# How to install and run the project

* If you are workingg on a project that a user needs to install or run localy in a machine like a "POS", you should includ the steps required to install your project and also the required dependencies if any.

* Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the developmenet environment set and running.

# How to use the project

* Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a probem - they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

* You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

* Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials. 

# Include Credits

* If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles and socia media too.

* This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of your project. 

# Add a license

* For most README files, this is usually considered the last part. It lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.

* We have different types of licenses depending on the kind of project you are working on. Depending on the one you will choose it will determine the contributions your project gets. 

* The most common one is the GPL License which allows other to make modification to your code and use it for commerical purposes. If you need help choosing a license, use check out this link: [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

* Up to this point what we hae covered are the minimum requirements for a good README. But you might also want to consider adding the followin sections to make it more eye catching and interactive.

# Badges (Optional)

* Badges are not necessary, but using them is a simple way of letting other developers know what you are doing.

* Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io){:target="_blank"}. They have a lot of badges to help you get started.

# How to contribute to the project

* This is very useful if you are developing an open-source project that you will need other developers to contribute to. You will want to add guidelines to let them know how they can contribute to your project.

# Include tests

* Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide code examples and how to run them. 

* This will help show that you are certain and confident that your project will work without any challenges, which will give other people confidence in it too.
